            <p>Part of my job consists in maintaining the popular Angular widget library <a

                    rel="noreferrer noopener">@ngbootstrap/ng-bootstrap</a> we created & open-sourced back in 2015.</p>
            <p>Rest of the job is related to training activities. Since we introduced the usage of Angular as
                technical recommendation, we also prepared 2 different training courses: Angular Fundamentals (2 days
                long)
                & Angular Advanced (2 days long).<br>
                Here again, we have trained several hundreds of world-wide developers internally.</p>

            <p>During this period, we introduced <a href="https://angularjs.org" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer noopener">angular.js</a> as a technical recommendation for any new front-end
                developments. This has started the decommission of our in-house previous solution: Aria Templates.</p>
            <p>In order to ease the migration of our work forces to this new stack, we created an internal 3 days long
                training course to help them learn angular. We delivered this training world-wide, in all our dev-based
                offices.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, we also had to support & maintain all other teams using the legacy in-house stack in their
                products.</p>

                I participated in the design, architecture, development and maintenance of an internal client/server
                application framework.
                Our goal was to provide product teams
                a solution to build next generation of desktop-class web-based apps.
                Used by hundreds within the company.

            <p>I also spent one year in a product team as an immersive experience. Goal was to help them better use our
                solution.</p>

                I joined the team in charge of maintaining airfrance.com e-commerce website.
                I implemented a back-end solution to detect and prevent robots from scraping pricing
                information from the web site (dynamic blacklisting).

                I also developed a few functionalities such as the real-time flights and timetable information modules
                and
                Flying Blue Program enrollment page.
                Evolution, load in production, internationalization, support and maintenance were also part of the daily
                job.
