    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>I am <b>Benoit Charbonnier</b>, <x-age>39yo</x-age>, husband, dad, and senior web developer.</p>

    <p>I can be found on the Internet as @<u>bcharbonnier</u> or @<u>benouat</u> on GitHub, as @<u>bencharbonnier</u> on
        Twitter and as @<u>bcharbonnier</u> on LinkedIn.</p>

    <p>I am working at @<u>AmadeusItGroup</u> as frontend principal engineer.
        I spend half my time maintaining the open-source project @<u>ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap</u>.
        The other half consists in delivering internal Angular trainings to my peers.</p>

    <p>I love working with web technologies, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and all their fancy friends.
        And I've been loving that for more than 15 years now.
        With a specific focus on JavaScript frameworks.
        Designing, crafting, coding, testing, using, rewriting and maintaining these frameworks to build enterprise
        graded web-apps.</p>

    <p>I graduated French engineering school ISITV in 2004, with a master degree in Computer Science and Networks.</p>

    <p>Before @<u>AmadeusITGroup</u>, I worked at @<u>AKKAFrance</u> as consultant in web technology as well (Java,
        J2EE, HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
        And before that, I started my career at @<u>airfrance</u>, working on airfrance.com.
        Some of my pages might still be online, or at least I like to think so.</p>

    <p>During my spare time, I enjoy valuable time with my family, but also I do web development (how surprising!?) and
        some woodworking (more surprising!).</p>

    <p>If you are still reading here, you are either very curious, or you might really be interested in my skills. If
        so, please contact me at <b>benoit.charbonnier@gmail.com</b>.</p>
