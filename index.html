Hello, I am Benoit Charbonnier
39, husband, dad, and web developer.
I can be found on the Internet as @bcharbonnier or @benouat on GitHub, as @bencharbonnier on Twitter and as @bcharbonnier on LinkedIn.

I am working @AmadeusItGroup as front-end principal engineer.
I spend half my time maintaining the open-source project @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap.
The other half consist in delivering internal Angular trainings to my peers.

I've been working with web technologies, using mostly HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
And I've been doing that for more than 15 years now.
Thinking, crafting, coding, testing, using and maintaining JavaScript frameworks to build enterprise graded web applications.

I graduated a french engineering school in Computer Science and Network, ISITV

Before Amadeus, I worked at Akka as consultant in web technology domains (Java, j2ee, JavaScript)
And before that, I started my career at Air France, working on airfrance.com. Some of my pages might still be online, or at least I like to think so.
