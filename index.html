<pre>Hello</pre>
<pre>
I am <b>Benoit Charbonnier</b>, 39yo, husband, dad, and web developer.

I can be found on the Internet as @<u>bcharbonnier</u> or @<u>benouat</u> on GitHub, as @<u>bencharbonnier</u> on Twitter and as @<u>bcharbonnier</u> on LinkedIn.

I am working @<u>AmadeusItGroup</u> as front-end principal engineer.
I spend half my time maintaining the open-source project @<u>ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap</u>.
The other half consist in delivering internal Angular trainings to my peers.

I've been working with web technologies, using mostly HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
And I've been doing that for more than 15 years now.
Thinking, crafting, coding, testing, using, rewriting and maintaining JavaScript frameworks to build enterprise graded web applications.

I graduated a french engineering school in Computer Science and Network, ISITV in 2004.

Before @<u>AmadeusITGroup</u>, I worked at @<u>Akka</u> as consultant in web technology domains (Java, j2ee, JavaScript).
And before that, I started my career at @<u>airfrance</u>, working on airfrance.com.
Some of my pages might still be online, or at least I like to think so.

During my spare time, at night, I do web development (how surprising!) and woodworking (more surprising!).

If you read this entirely until here, you might be interested into my skills. If so you can contact me at <b>benoit.charbonnier@gmail.com</b>.
